## Project Structure

#### `back`
Restful API, db, model. 
Docs see [here](back/README.md)

#### `front`
HTML CSS JS stuff, simple ReactJS + SemanticUI frontend
**This is whatever runs in browser, NOT the `frontend` described in this project's requirement. `frontend` in project's requirement is implemented as a RESTFul API service, see [back/main.go](back/main.go)**
